# DevOps_Task-6

# Problem Statement :

1. Create container image that’s has Jenkins installed using dockerfile Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7.

2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.

3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.

4. Job2 ( Seed Job ) : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

5. Further on jobs should be pipeline using written code using Groovy language by the developer

6. Job1 : 
	A. By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )

	B. Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod

	C. Make the data to remain persistent using PVC ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )

7. Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not.

8. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the developer.
